# User-Behavior-on-the-basis-of-app-data
 We have a fairly new application being developed. This new app is simply a mobile application that tracks the all of the users activity such as browsing and shopping activity.

They were also interested in trying to possibly predict user behavior based on the usage data in the data they provided. For any given user, they want to see if they can use a snapshot of what that person has done at this particular time and predict what they are doing.

The data is provided in the data directory as train.csv and test.csv,
